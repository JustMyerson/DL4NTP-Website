					<h3>Obtaining SANReN Data</h3>
					<p>
						The first step in conducting our research was to obtain times-
						series network traffic data from SANReN. This data was
						accessed through the University of Cape Town. The data is
						stored as tab-separated .csv files, and each data set consists
						of a multitude of variables, each describing the quality of the
						network traffic flows on SANReN over a measured period of
						time. The SANReN data has been placed on a data store at the
						University of Cape Town - which is available to be accessed
						remotely. However, for this research project, a smaller 47000-
						observation sample was used to train, validate and test the
						LSTMs that this paper evaluates. An example of the format
						of the SANReN data is provided on the right. The response variable for
						this project is Bytes per flow.
					</p>
					<h3>Data Engineering</h3>
					<p>
						The raw SANReN data has to be extracted and cleaned for
						a neural network model. This preprocessing step transforms. raw data into input for each of the
						neural network
						models. Initially, the categorical features
						were encoded using one-hot encoding - which creates a new
						binary column for each instance of a categorical variable
						- however, this caused the DataFrame’s dimensions to increase dramatically and had little impact on the predictive
						power of the LSTM models - so the categorical variables
						were subsequently dropped from the DataFrame.

					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, to capture the relationship between South
						African university schedules and network traffic data, two
						new variables were engineered. The first is a simple day
						variable - which numerically encodes the day of the week -
						and the second is a binary holiday variable - which asserts
						whether the network flow occurred during a university holiday or not. The holiday dates were defined by the University
						of Cape Town’s academic schedule for 2020. Byte values were encoded to 64-bit float representations, strings were removed -
						as strings are not acceptable input for a TensorFlow LSTM -
						and temporal values were encoded to 64-bit integer nanosecond representations.

						<h2>Preliminary Data Analysis<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To provide insight
						into the underlying patterns, correlations and composition
						of the SANReN data, a preliminary statistical analysis was
						performed.
					</p>
					<p>
						To
						investigate the possibility of multicollinearity, a correlation
						matrix was plotted. There are strong correlations between Bytes, Packets and Duration. The option of removing
						all of the variables apart from the three that make up the
						stronger, yellow correlations in the upper left of the matrix
						was considered, although due to the non-linearity of the data,
						this design decision was rejected. Other correlative relationships of interest are the negative relationship between Bytes
						and Datetime and the strong positive relationship between
						Duration and the response. In this sample, the weak correlation between Bytes and Datetime suggest that the byte
						volume per flow is decreasing as time increases. Importantly,
						this does not imply that there is less network traffic in general because network traffic volume is a function of byte
						per flow as well as the number of flows. The relationship
						between Bytes and Duration implies that longer flows generally have more data being transferred - which is a sensible
						assumption.
					</p>
					<p>The preliminary data analysis provides an opportunity
						to garner insight into whether SANReN traffic data varies with time and
						day in relation to the South African university calendar. 
						To extract the relationship between time of day, university holidays
						and byte volumes, a pair of scatter plots were fitted. The figure on the left show the total byte flows over each day of the week.
						Surprisingly, there is noclear distinction between bytes flows during the week compared to the weekend. Similarly, the total byte flow per
						per type of day is shown. Again, it is surprising to see that the total byte flows are higher on
						average
						during a holiday. This is unexpected, as the SANReN links
						research units and other university-related institutions.</p>

						In the context of a distribution, skewness is a measure of how asymmetric the data is.
						It is clear that the data is extremely skewed to the right, indicated by the density of low byte value observations to the left
						of the curve, and the massive byte flows shown as one moves
						along the tail to the right. The outlying values have the effect
						of increasing the mean of the data. It is important to note
						that the LSTM models in this project are designed to capture
						outlying burst flows, although the magnitude of some of
						the outliers in the SANReN data means that the models may
						under-predict these observations under testing conditions. The five
						number summary in the table shows the response values in megabytes and demonstrates
						the magntitude of outliers in the dataset. The max byte flow is 56 times larger than the average flow.
					</p>
					<h3>LSTM Data Preparation</h3>
					<p>
						All machine learning algorithms require that the input data is split into training
						and testing samples. The training data is the sample of the
						SANReN data that is used to adjust the weights of the LSTM.
						For our implementation of the LSTMs, the training sample
						is 64% of the full input sample. Additionally, the training
						sample is split to produce the validation set. An interesting
						observation is identified when examining how the validation
						set is constructed. To ensure the sequential nature of the
						data, the data is not shuffled when it is split into training
						and test sets, and it is not shuffled when being split into
						training and validation sets. he information provided
						by the validation set - primarily the out-of-sample MSE of
						the fitted model - allows the hyperparameters of the model
						to be adjusted. The model’s evaluation on the validation set
						becomes more biased as the hyperparameters are adjusted.
						This is because the model starts to fit the validation set better
						as the information it provides is incorporated into the model
						configuration. In our implementation, the validation set is
						20% of the training set. Lastly, the test set is the sample of
						data that is used to provide a truly unbiased evaluation of
						the final model fit. The test set is used as input to the final,
						trained model.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the train, test and validation sets have been created,
						LSTM models require that all data is normalised to an equal
						range of values. The MinMaxScaler from the scikit-learn
						package scales all variables to a range of 0 to 1. Usually,
						categorical variables would have to be encoded separately,
						however, the categorical variables of the SANReN dataset
						have not been used as predictors in the LSTM models. After the LSTM models have been implemented, the response
						can be predicted. However, due to the scaled nature of the
						inputs, the output is also a scaled value between 0 and 1. To
						convert the LSTM predicted response back to a byte value, a
						MinMaxScaler is used. The data is then fully prepared, and
						ready to be given to the LSTM models.

						<h2>Stacked LSTM<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>A stacked LSTM is a simple LSTM
						with multiple LSTM layers. Rather than a hidden layer immediately producing a scalar output, the LSTM layer will provide a sequence output to the LSTM
						layer below it. This
						implies that the data remains in a three-dimensional format
						whilst it passes through each of the hidden LSTM layers,
						before being converted to the required scalar value.
						Our implementation of a stacked LSTM in Keras uses
						three LSTM layers, each with the same number of neurons.
						Essentially, an LSTM layer returns
						a sequential output rather than a single scalar. The output
						layer, the Dense layer in Keras, outputs a scalar prediction
						based on the three-dimensional input it receives from the
						LSTM layer above it.
					</p>
					<h3>Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
					<p>
						All three of the LSTM models are parameterised functions,
						meaning that there is an optimal combination of parameters
						that will minimise the chosen cost function and produce the
						best performing model [29]. This process is known as hyperparameter tuning. The simple, bidirectional and stacked
						LSTM models were fitted over a range of hyperparameters.
						In the context of LSTMs, these parameters are epochs - the
						number of times the data is passed through the model - and
						neurons - the number of memory units in each LSTM layer.
						In this study, each LSTM model was trained using a range
						of epochs from 25 to 150, with 25 epoch intervals, and with
						50 or 100 neurons in each LSTM layer of the model. This
						resulted in 12 permutations of hyperparameter combinations for each model.
					</p>

					<p>The optimisation of the stacked LSTM was done using Mean Average Error, Mean Squared Error and
						Rsquared as assesors of the model's performance on training and validation data. The entire
						optimisation process can be
						seen in Antony's Final Paper, although Figure ? best demonstrates why the stacked LSTM was
						optimised the way it was. The optimal
						hyperparameters for the stacked LSTM model are 100 epochs and 50 neurons.
