					<p>
						Time series forecasting is a method that uses models fitted
						on historical data to predict future values of an observation.
						<strong>Network traffic prediction</strong> is a form of time series forecasting
						that allows computer network operators to manage their
						networks more efficiently. Accurate traffic prediction can
						improve a network’s performance significantly, in areas such
						as network congestion management, resource distribution
						and network volume alerts. Most neural network models
						find it difficult to learn the long-range temporal relationships
						in a dataset - primarily due to the non-stationary and
						non-linear qualities that time-series data presents. However,
						existing literature suggests that <strong>Long Short Term Memory
							(LSTM)</strong> models can capture the long and short-term trends
						in network traffic data. This paper implements three LSTM
						models for network traffic prediction on the SANReN. The South African
						National Research and Education Network(SANReN). SANReN is a country-wide network of educa
						tion and research institutions in South Africa. It is a
						high-speed network for science, education, research and
						innovation-based institutions, and has been phased in across
						the country since 2007. As a large, federated network,
						SANReN could benefit from an LSTM model that allows for
						preemptive network actions.

						<h2>The Problem <br /></h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Modern computer networks are facing the challenges as-
						sociated with transferring unprecedented amounts of data.
						Furthermore, large, confederated computer networks exhibit
						volatile network traffic flows. Historically, network operators
						have attempted to use traditional statistical learning
						methods to optimise their networks. However, as
						network flows increase dramatically, network operators
						require more efficient and accurate time-series processing
						methods to overcome network congestion, reduce access
						times, allocate bandwidth effectively and detect traffic anomalies.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is important to consider the constraints and resources of
						a network when evaluating a candidate model for network
						traffic prediction. Both computational complexity and run
						time can be a limiting factor for less-resourced networks
						such as SANReN, which may result in different network
						traffic prediction models being better suited for networks
						of this class. LSTM derivative models, such as the
						stacked LSTM and bilateral LSTM, have been shown to out-performe base-
						line, vanilla LSTMs. Whilst the predictive performance of an LSTM is the primary
						focus of this project, the computational feasibility of LSTM
						and LSTM-derivative prediction models will also be investigated.
					</p>
					<p>The SANREN data was extracted from the SANREN server. 
							Traffic flows from 5 consecutive days (5 - 10 July 2020) were extracted. 
							In order to standardise the data, all traffic flows were converted into bytes to create a single unit of measurement.
							The LSTM models were evaluated during and after training. During training, the training and validation losses were measured. 
							When predicting future traffic flows, they were then assessed on their prediction accuracy.</p>
							<p>The Bidirectional, Simple and Stacked LSTM models were all developed in Python.
							The Simple LSTM served as a benchmark with which to compare our Bidirectional and Stacked LSTMs.
							Once training validation error reaches a minimum, training is stopped and those hyperparamters are used for testing.</p>

							<li>
								The results show that the stacked LSTM is the most accurate model. It had the best MSE by 40% and the highest R2 by 23%. ​However, it also takes the longest to train – nearly double the simpler models. ​
							</li><li>
								Prediction accuracy for all models increased with sample size - at the cost of an increased training time.​
							</li><li>
								The Bidirectional LSTM is the least accurate predictor and does not justify its additional complexity.​
							</li><li>
								The preliminary statistical analysis also determined that there is no obvious pattern linking SANREN network traffic flows with the university calendar.
