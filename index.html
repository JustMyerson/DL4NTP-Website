						Time series forecasting is a method that uses models fitted
						on historical data to predict future values of an observation.
						<strong>Network traffic prediction</strong> is a form of time series forecasting
						that allows computer network operators to manage their
						networks more efficiently. Accurate traffic prediction can
						improve a network’s performance significantly, in areas such
						as network congestion management, resource distribution
						and network volume alerts. Most neural network models
						find it difficult to learn the long-range temporal relationships
						in a dataset - primarily due to the non-stationary and
						non-linear qualities that time-series data presents. However,
						existing literature suggests that <strong>Long Short Term Memory
							(LSTM)</strong> models can capture the long and short-term trends
						in network traffic data. This paper implements three LSTM
						models for network traffic prediction on the SANREN. The South African
						National Research and Education Network(SANREN). SANREN is a country-wide network of educa
						tion and research institutions in South Africa. It is a
						high-speed network for science, education, research and
						innovation-based institutions, and has been phased in across
						the country since 2007. As a large, federated network,
						SANREN could benefit from an LSTM model that allows for
						preemptive network actions.

						<h2>The Problem</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Modern computer networks are facing the challenges associated with transferring unprecedented
						amounts of data.
						Furthermore, large computer networks exhibit
						volatile network traffic flows. Historically, network operators
						have attempted to use statistical learning
						methods to optimise their networks. However, as
						network flows increase, network operators
						require more efficient and accurate time-series processing
						methods to overcome network congestion, reduce access
						times, allocate bandwidth effectively and detect traffic anomalies.
				<br>
				<br>
						It is important to consider the constraints and resources of
						a network when evaluating a candidate model for network
						traffic prediction. Both computational complexity and run
						time can be a limiting factor for less-resourced networks
						such as SANREN, which may result in different network
						traffic prediction models being better suited for networks
						of this class. LSTM derivative models, such as the
						stacked LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM, have been shown to out-perform base-
						line, vanilla LSTMs. Whilst the predictive performance of an LSTM is the primary
						focus of this project, the computational feasibility of LSTM
						and LSTM-derivative prediction models will also be investigated.

					<h2>Individual Work</h2>
					<p>The data pipeline was split up so that work could be parallelized.
						The Bidirectional, Simple and Stacked LSTM models were all developed in Python using Keras,
						whilst the preprocessing
						and data analysis was done using pandas and NumPy. In this project, the Simple LSTM served as a
						benchmark with which to compare our Bidirectional and Stacked LSTMs.

					<p>
							Before searching for the optimal models across the hyperparameter space, it is important
							to define how each model will be evaluated. Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error are both measures of how close a model’s predicted val-
							ues are to the actual observed value. Furthermore, the Coefficient of Determination - R<sup>2</sup> - is
							used to evaluate the models. It shows the proportion of the
							variance in the response that can be explained by the inde-
							pendent features. In this case, it shows the proportion of the
							variation in Bytes that can be explained by the numerical
							features in the dataset. The training time of each LSTM was also used as a proxy for complexity, with the results of each model
						variation shown on the left.</p>
					<p>
							The hyperparameter search allowed each model to be optimised independently. According to the information the
							training and validation sets provide, the optimised models
							are a 100-neuron simple LSTM over 125 epochs, a 50-neuron
							bilateral LSTM over 150 epochs, and a 50-neuron stacked
							LSTM over 100 epochs. Based on these hyperparameters, the
							prediction results on an unseen test set are provided on the left.

					<h3>The Results Won't Surpise You</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The Stacked LSTM is the most accurate predictor of future traffic flows on the SANREN. It
							had the best test MSE by 40% and the highest test R<sup>2</sup> by 23%. ​However, it also takes the
							longest to train –
							nearly double the time as the Simple and Bidirectional models. ​
							<ul>
								<li>A graphical representation of the Stacked LSTM's model performance can be seen on the right.</li>
								<li>If the Stacked LSTM’s
										training time - which is two times greater than both simpler
										models - is prohibitive, then a network provider may decide
										that the predictive performance of the simple LSTM model
										is sufficient.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Prediction accuracy for all models increased with sample size - at the cost of an increased
							training time.​ Prediction time on the other hand was
							consistently low in our testing.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							The Bidirectional LSTM is the least accurate predictor and does not justify its additional
							complexity over the Simple LSTM.​
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							The preliminary statistical analysis also determined that there is no obvious pattern
							linking SANREN network traffic flows with the university calendar, nor the day of the week.
